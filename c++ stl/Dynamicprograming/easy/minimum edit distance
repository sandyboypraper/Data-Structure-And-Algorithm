// make a mattrix of n*m, n is the lenth of one string and m is of other

// let suppose the case we calculate the case when we want to convert length 3 to length 3
// and we know l2 to l3,l3 to l2,l2 to l2
//so we take min of cost for(l2 to l3,l3 to l2,l2 to l2) and add 1 to it to get l3 to l3
// and so on for other
// if we choose l2 to l2 then we just add other no so +1
// if we choose l2 to l3 then we have to replace the last no so +1
// if we choose l3 to l2 then we add other no so +1


// and if the 3rd no of one string is equal to 3rd no of other then we take l2 to l2 for l3 to l3 without +1;
